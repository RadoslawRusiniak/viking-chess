display corners and throne in other way than the rest of the fields

use engine's setupposition and pass board from json

introduce concept of player and connect it to pawns
  => check if clicked pawn is a pawn of a player to move, if not ignore click

setup position feature

remove "Dummy" Msg if possible

change wording - whomoves -> who's turn in jsons and code

maybe: pass all json in body of post requests

separate board and options in view

make it look awesome... or at least better
