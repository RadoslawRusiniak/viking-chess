improve setup position feature

remove "Dummy" Msg if possible

change wording - whomoves -> who's turn in jsons and code

create separate model file for gamestate, history, (maybe also move or location) etc. with decoders/encoders

separate board and options in view (done a little bit, but maybe separate files?)

make it look awesome... or at least better
